You have come to me thinking I am going to give you a new religion no I am not going to give you such comfort so that you can sleep well I want to disturbed so as it's my commitment and duty to show people what I see so many time with answers there was I had a grand uncle who passed away a few years ago at the age of 101 he was a very humiliation gregarious man so he had a son and adopted son and that boy just not interested in education nor was I but I was I always made sure I went to the next class I didn't want to be left Behind but that boy is sort of not doing well in school so when we went for vacation to their place so

Grand uncle ask me what laws are you I say I am 6th standard you Laya just lost your you told me 5266 looked over boy always his number 5 he tells the truth what can I do for you hello you flip the coin and it felt like I said it helps you reply flip a coin said it takes all your line but suppose if it's multifaceted let's say you through dies acid 104 I said to myself 386 I am lying what can I do with you you should leave on a flat Earth and fortunately surround and its paining never shows the same face to you again this is why there are two dimensions of life this one called in one that is absolute its dimensions of life with absolute so that the dimensions of life is a constantly changing in a way this is represented within us as energy and in the world as well in human terms masculine and feminine and sun and moon sun is always around everyday round perfect round hello did you ever see a square one in California you might have when you are on certain things when it came square like that but look at them moon everyday is a different shape hello 12 days 11 disappears everyday different shape so this is what is confounding people even about women with everyday different shape men is very 16 oriented you want everyday round like that like somebody said I don't remember I think this is said the difference between man and woman is in marriage women always expecting the man to change 

in the first class compartment and tourism management a Macaw parrot was in his neighbouring seat wearing a seat belt and singer and then before the Apple intakes of the parrot us I want Scotch whisky this says no till we take off we cannot serve you and in the choices the words the parrot abuses Ho litany of everything I know you are in the channel if I don't have to join full dictionary throws at the woman had she is like doesn't know what to do but I've used then after take xxxxov again the parrots creams I want my scotch on the other side there doing ting ting tong ting in Bottles And glasses and something on the parrot green view more on what are you doing that was the man order se cook then he sees this and is very impressed by the parrot then Bada Don orders one more round and again screams at everybody because it's delete hand man orders another coc now he thought he should also do it I am just sitting like a month not asking for my he also helps then this match continuous that as food and healthy food and health then the crew has a small conference cancel the pilot and they come the pickup both of them open the door and throw them out of the flight both of them I'm going down and the parrot says you really have guts for a man without wings because life is a most dynamic phenomena that you want to be a Fossil hello you want to be a Fossil everything that certain because you say you suffer uncertainty isn't it hello what is called a security in life is fossilis life nothing should change no change this what to do all the time it changing its very dynamic so as it mine commitment and duty and it's my mission to see or to show people what I see today moon is justice labour should I say moon is round yes it is Ground from where I know that you look at it from the other side it is now it in our experience sister syllabus today hello no moon is round it's not like that life on one Level it is round it is true it is round always Raat

but in our experience it keeps changing there are different aspects to life if you think everything is black and white everything is yes no then you must join the Communist Party what is used for what is not your so I just decided hello hello is there anything not useful you might think it's not useful it has his own life it has its own use yes or no a small acoustic is it used to you may not use if somebody else is using it a grasshopper is it useless hello know it usually does a fulfilled life of his own so you are thinking of everything is absolute according to your ID zoology or your emotional status aur your philosophy or your religion everything is absolute this where that way good or bad I keep seeing this even in the news channel international news channels from national news channels from United States actually the anchor speaking good guys and bad guys I could believe this you mean you meet the most bad guy who are you think is a waste bad guy he also thinks is good hello if you know who is back to us who is good to us is a context of where we are what we are getting at that moment you should know you must all at least of this much you should never used the word bad whether its raining its knowing it is hard but it's not bad weather hello who are you to decide whether is bad have a don't usage words because this is all establishing division division division division absolutism means divide divide in the end fight each other and I this is all coming because we have an absolutist mind mind should be flute only then its intelligent if it becomes absolute in some way it becomes a concrete block with a concrete block you can but other people in the face hello this is one use of the head isn't it you can but people in the face or you can use your brains to do something meaningful and worthwhile for you and for every other life on this planet and this is not civics this is not environmental science this is pretty process that you use your head to do something wonderful to yourself and everybody or use your head to make somebody's nose bleed you can use the head both ways right
